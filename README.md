# Beacon

Beacon is a file sharing service that allows for quick and easy sharing of files via either the
terminal or a web panel. It was developed as free individual project for university.

## Configuration

By default, the server configuration is located in the `beacon.toml` file.
The location of this file can be altered by setting the `BEACON_SERVER_CONFIG` environment variable
to the desired path.
